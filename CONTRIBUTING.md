- Lint using [black](https://github.com/psf/black) by running `black .`
- Test breaking changes by running `tox -e 27` and `tox -e 3x` where 3x is your python version.
e.g. `tox -e 38`

## About the database
`data.db` is a sqlite3 database file with the table named `data` with following schema:
```
CREATE TABLE data(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, txt TEXT);
CREATE INDEX ind_name ON data(id);
```
There are exactly 6000 rows each having an ID from 1 to 6000.
The data is provided by typeracerdata.com.
